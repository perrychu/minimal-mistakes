## Some notes on workflow for time-series:

### Typical steps:
1) Visualize time series
2) Stationarize
3) Plot ACF / PACF
4) Build ARIMA model
5) Predict

### Attributes of a stationary TS:
1) Mean is constant (required)
2) Variance is constant (required)
3) Frequency is constant (sometimes)
  - Implies seasonality
  - Not applicable for non-repeating patterns
