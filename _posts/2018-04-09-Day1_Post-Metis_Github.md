## Cleaning Up Github
Today is my first day as a Metis grad! I'm excited to continue learning - building on the base of skills I've acquired through Metis - and also excited to be out in the wild, tracking down a career in data science. 

As a first step on this journey, I want to publish my portfolio. Over the past 3 months, I've labored over multiple end-to-end data projects... but there's no way for anyone else to see that! 

In addition, this is a good opportunity to practice with git! While I'm comfortable with the "day-to-day" workflows around fork/pull and working/staging/commit, I want to practice using more of git's features and get familiar with how git is used in practice. 

After uploading my code, I also want to make sure I clearly communicate what I've done. I'll write ReadMes for the repos I post and do a little extra code / jupyter notebook cleanup. I'll also post the presentations I created which help illuminate the project intent and results.

This will be a work-in-progress over the next few days, but here's the plan:
1) Upload projects to github / research style & naming conventions
2) Make sure my repos effectively communicate purpose, process, & results
3) Document / plan project extensions which I didn't have time to do during bootcamp
4) Practice git commands (branches, logs, tags, rebase, etc) and github features (insights, issues, project boards)
5) Read up on how git is used in practice (development workflows)

* [Repo naming conventions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11947587/is-there-a-naming-convention-for-git-repositories) - tldr: lower case & dash (-) separated is most common 
* [Grouping repos on github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20908994/grouping-repos-on-github) - tldr: there's not a standard, pre-fixing is widely used or can be done via organizations
