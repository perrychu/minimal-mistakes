## Day 1: Github

Today is my first day as a Metis grad! I'm excited to continue learning - building on the base of skills I've acquired through Metis - and also excited to be out in the wild, tracking down a career in data science. 

As a first step on this journey, I want to publish my portfolio. Over the past 3 months, I've labored over multiple end-to-end data projects... but there's no way for anyone to see that!

This will be a work-in-progress over the next few days, but I have a few main goals:
1) Make sure my repos effectively communicate purpose, process, & results
2) Learn git / github best practices & rules of thumb (which should help with part 1)
3) Document / plan workflow for extensions of the projects which I didn't have time to do during bootcamp

For part 1 & 3, I need to write ReadMes for the repos I post and do a little extra code / jupyter notebook cleanup. I'll also post the presentations I created. Here are steps for uploading existing project files to github:
* [Uploading an existing project to github](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)

For part 2, I've found a few useful links:
* [Agis's git style guide](https://github.com/agis/git-style-guide) - tldr: Have been linked to this many times!
* [Repo naming conventions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11947587/is-there-a-naming-convention-for-git-repositories) - tldr: lower case & dash (-) separated is most common 
* [Grouping repos on github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20908994/grouping-repos-on-github) - tldr: there's not a standard, pre-fixing is widely used or can be done via organizations
