## Day 1: Github

Today is my first day as a Metis grad! I'm excited to continue learning - building on the base of skills I've acquired through Metis - and also excited to be out in the wild, tracking down a career in data science. 

As a first step on this journey, I want to publish my portfolio. Over the past 3 months, I've labored over multiple end-to-end data projects... but there's no way for anyone else to see that!

This will be a work-in-progress over the next few days, but I have a few main goals / steps:
1) Put my code into github repos!
2) Learn git / github best practices & rules of thumb (which should help with part 1)
2) Make sure my repos effectively communicate purpose, process, & results
3) Document / plan workflow for extensions of the projects which I didn't have time to do during bootcamp

## To-dos & useful links:
I've learned the workflows around fork-pull and working-stage-commit during Metis, but the focus has been "get stuff done" rather than "understand why". Goals 1 and 2 are to learn the other features of git / github (branches, logs, tags, rebase, etc.) and then better understand the best practices for a full project lifecycle.

Part 1 links: How-to / technical guides:
* [Uploading an existing project to github](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)
* [Pros/cons of github via https vs ssh](https://gist.github.com/grawity/4392747)
* [Everyday git commands](https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday)
* [More detailed command explanations](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository)

Part 2 links: Style / convention guides:
* [Agis's git style guide](https://github.com/agis/git-style-guide) - tldr: Have been linked to this many times!
* [Repo naming conventions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11947587/is-there-a-naming-convention-for-git-repositories) - tldr: lower case & dash (-) separated is most common 
* [Grouping repos on github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20908994/grouping-repos-on-github) - tldr: there's not a standard, pre-fixing is widely used or can be done via organizations
* [Fork-pull vs. branch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3611256/forking-vs-branching-in-github)
* [Branching model for bigger projects](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

For parts 3 & 4, I'll write ReadMes for the repos I post and do a little extra code / jupyter notebook cleanup. I'll also post the presentations I created.
