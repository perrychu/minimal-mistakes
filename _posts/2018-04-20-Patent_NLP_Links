I'm going to be doing some work with NLP for patents. This is a collection of research notes and relevant links. 

Ways to group
* Technology classification (USPTO / WIPO)
* Citations (But 70% of patents not cited, 5 citations is very high)
* Machine learning prediction
* Machine learning clustering

## Links
* [Vector space model for patent similarity](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2709238)
  * From https://www.patrf.org/technology/
