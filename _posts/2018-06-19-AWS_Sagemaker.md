Attended an Amazon workshop about sagemaker today at the AWS Loft (525 Market St). Neat space.

Sagemaker abstracts the infrastructure for training (including gpu & distributed instances) and hosting (distributed endpoints) models. It seems particularly compelling for deep learning, where the set-up is quite involved.  

Its a relatively new service (since late 2017?) and still growing... There aren't too many external resources about it yet, although Amazon's documentation and example code is pretty good.
